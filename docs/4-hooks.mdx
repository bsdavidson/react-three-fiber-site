# Hooks

All hooks can only be used *inside* the Canvas element because they rely on context updates!

## useThree()

This hooks gives you access to all the basic objects that are kept internally, like the default renderer, scene, camera. It also gives you the size of the canvas in screen and viewport coordinates. When you resize the canvas, or the browser window, your component will be updated with fresh values. 

```jsx
import { useThree } from 'react-three-fiber'

const { 
  gl,               // WebGL renderer
  canvas,           // canvas the dom element that was created
  scene,            // Default scene
  camera,           // Default camera
  size,             // Bounds of the view (which stretches 100% and auto-adjusts)
  viewport,         // Bounds of the viewport in 3d units + factor (size/viewport)
  aspect,           // Aspect ratio (size.width / size.height)
  invalidate,       // Invalidates a single frame (for <Canvas invalidateFrameloop />)
  setDefaultCamera  // Sets the default camera
} = useThree()
```

## useRender(callback, takeOver=false)

If you're running effects, postprocessings, controls, etc that need to get updated every frame, useRender gives you access to the render-loop. You receive the internal state as well, which is the same as what you would get from useThree.

```jsx
import { useRender } from 'react-three-fiber'

// Subscribes to the render-loop, gets cleaned up automatically when the component unmounts
useRender(state => console.log("I'm in the render-loop"))

// Add a "true" as the 2nd argument and you take over the render-loop completely
useRender(({ gl, scene, camera }) => gl.render(scene, camera), true)
```

## useUpdate(callback, denpendencies, optionalRef=undefined)

Sometimes objects have to be updated imperatively. You could update the parts that you can access declaratively and then call `onUpdate={self => ...}`, or there's useUpdate.

```jsx
import { useUpdate } from 'react-three-fiber'

const ref = useUpdate( 
  geometry => {
    geometry.addAttribute('position', getCubeVertices(x, y, z))
    geometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true
    geometry.computeBoundingSphere()
  }, 
  [x, y, z], // execute only if these properties change
)
return <bufferGeometry ref={ref} />
```

## useResource(optionalRef=undefined)


Materials and such aren't normally re-created for every instance using it. You may want to share and re-use resources. This can be done imperatively simply by maintaining the object yourself, but it can also be done declaratively by using refs. `useResource` simply creates a ref and re-renders the component when it becomes available next frame. You can pass this reference on, or even channel it through a context provider.

```jsx
import { useResource } from 'react-three-fiber'

const [ref, material] = useResource()
return (
  <meshBasicMaterial ref={ref} />
  {material && (
    <mesh material={material} />
    <mesh material={material} />
    <mesh material={material} />
  )}
)
```
