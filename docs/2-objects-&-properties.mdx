# Objects and properties

You can use [Three's entire object catalogue and all properties](https://threejs.org/docs). When in doubt, always consult the docs.

```jsx
<mesh
  visible
  userData={{ test: "hello" }}
  position={new THREE.Vector3(1, 2, 3)}
  rotation={new THREE.Euler(0, 0, 0)}
  geometry={new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 16, 16)}
  material={new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: new THREE.Color('indianred'), transparent: true })} />
```

## Shortcuts and non-Object3D stow-away

All properties that have a `.set()` method (colors, vectors, euler, matrix, etc) can be given a shortcut. For example [THREE.Color.set](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Color.set) can take a color string, hence instead of `color={new THREE.Color('peachpuff')}` you can do `color="peachpuff"`. Some `set` methods take multiple arguments (vectors for instance), in this case you can pass an array.

You can stow away non-Object3D primitives (geometries, materials, etc) into the render tree so that they become managed and reactive. They take the same properties they normally would, constructor arguments are passed with `args`. Using the `attach` property objects bind automatically to their parent and are taken off it once they unmount.

The following is the same as above, but it's leaner and critical properties aren't re-instantiated on every render.

```jsx
<mesh visible userData={{ test: "hello" }} position={[1, 2, 3]} rotation={[0, 0, 0]}>
  <sphereGeometry attach="geometry" args={[1, 16, 16]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color="indianred" transparent />
</mesh>
```

You can nest primitive objectsâ€”which is good for awaiting async textures and such. You could use React-suspense if you wanted!

```jsx
<meshBasicMaterial attach="material">
  <texture attach="map" format={THREE.RGBFormat} image={img} onUpdate={self => img && (self.needsUpdate = true)} />
</meshBasicMaterial>
```

Sometimes attaching isn't enough. For example, this code attaches effects to an array called "passes" of the parent `effectComposer`. Note the use of `attachArray` which adds the object to the target array and takes it out on unmount:

```jsx
<effectComposer>
  <renderPass attachArray="passes" />
  <glitchPass attachArray="passes" renderToScreen />
</effectComposer>
```

You can also attach to named parent properties using `attachObject={[target, name]}`, which adds the object and takes it out on unmount. The following adds a buffer-attribute to parent.attributes.position. 

```jsx
<bufferGeometry>
  <bufferAttribute
    attachObject={['attributes', 'position']}
    count={vertices.length / 3}
    array={vertices}
    itemSize={3} />
</bufferGeometry>
```

## Piercing into nested properties

If you want to reach into nested attributes (for instance: `mesh.rotation.x`), just use dash-case:

```jsx
<mesh rotation-x={1} material-color="lightblue" geometry-vertices={newVertices} />
```

## Putting already existing objects into the scene-graph

You can use the `primitive` placeholder for that. You can still give it properties or attach nodes to it.

```jsx
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh()
return <primitive object={mesh} position={[0, 0, 0]} />
```

## Using 3rd-party (non THREE namespaced) objects in the scene-graph

The `apply` function extends three-fibers catalogue of known native elements. These objects become available and can now be directly instantiated.

```jsx
import { apply } from 'react-three-fiber'
import { EffectComposer } from './postprocessing/EffectComposer'
import { RenderPass } from './postprocessing/RenderPass'

apply({ EffectComposer, RenderPass })

<effectComposer>
  <renderPass />
</effectComposer>
```
