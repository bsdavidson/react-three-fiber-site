# Canvas

The `Canvas` object is your portal into Threejs. It renders Threejs elements, *not DOM elements*!

```jsx
<Canvas
  children                      // Either a function child (which receives state) or regular children
  gl                            // Props that go into the default webGL-renderer
  camera                        // Props that go into the default camera
  raycaster                     // Props that go into the default raycaster
  orthographic = false          // Creates an orthographic camera if true
  pixelRatio = undefined        // You could provide window.devicePixelRatio if you like 
  invalidateFrameloop = false   // When true it only renders on changes, when false it's a game loop
  onCreated />                  // Callback when vdom is ready (you can block first render via promise)
```

You can give it additional properties like style and className, which will be added to the container (a div) that holds the dom-canvas element.

## Defaults

Canvas will create a *translucent webGL-renderer* with the following properties: 

`antialias: true, alpha: true, setClearAlpha(0)`

A default *perspective camera*:

`fov: 75, near: 0.1, far: 1000, position.z: 5`

Or a default *orthographic camera* if Canvas.orthographic is true:

`near: 0.1, far: 1000, position.z: 5`

A default scene (into which all the jsx is rendered) and a raycaster. You do not have to use any of these objects, look under "receipes" down below if you want to bring your own.
