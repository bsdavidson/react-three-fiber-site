# Rendering only when needed

By default it renders like a game loop, which isn't that battery efficient. Switch on `invalidateFrameloop` to activate loop invalidation, which is automatic most of the time.

```jsx
<Canvas invalidateFrameloop ... />
```

Sometimes you must be able to kick off frames manually, for instance when you're dealing with async stuff or camera controls:

```jsx
const { invalidate } = useThree()
const texture = useMemo(() => loader.load(url1, invalidate), [url1])
```
