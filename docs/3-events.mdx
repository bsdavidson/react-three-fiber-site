# Events

THREE objects that implement their own `raycast` method (for instance meshes, lines, etc) can be interacted with by declaring events on the object. We support pointer events ([you need to polyfill them yourself](https://github.com/jquery/PEP)), clicks and wheel-scroll.

Additionally there's a special `onUpdate` that is called every time the object is updated with fresh props (as well as when it's first being created).

The event data you receive contains the browser event as well as the Threejs event data (object, point, distance, etc) all merged into one object.

```jsx
<mesh
  onClick={e => console.log('click')}
  onWheel={e => console.log('wheel spins')}
  onPointerUp={e => console.log('up')}
  onPointerDown={e => console.log('down')}
  onPointerOver={e => console.log('hover')}
  onPointerOut={e => console.log('unhover')}
  onPointerMove={e => console.log('move')}
  onUpdate={self => console.log('props have been updated')}
```

## Propagation and capturing

```jsx
  onPointerDown={e => {
    // Only the mesh closest to the camera will be processed
    e.stopPropagation()
    // You may optionally capture the target
    e.target.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId)
  }}
  onPointerUp={e => {
    e.stopPropagation()
    // Optionally release capture
    e.target.releasePointerCapture(e.pointerId)
  }}
```
